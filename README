Mumoro: MUltiModal MUltiObjective ROuting

This lib aims to provide multimodal routing: combining subway, walking and bike.
It can also be used as a basic routing algorithm.


We divided the project in three parts:
* lib: where everything interesting happens
* tools: various tools, to generate useable data
* ui: user interfaces, a graphical one based on marble for now

Requirements
* GCC: C++ complier (other aren't testetd)
* Boost: no C++ dev should live without it (used for its Dijkstra's algorithm)
* CMake: compling tool (replacing autotools and so on)
* SQLite: lightweight and fast SQL database

Optional requirements
* Marble: we use its widget for the standalone GUI
* Expat: for parsing osm data
